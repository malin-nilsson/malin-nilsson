## Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 I’m Malin, an aspiring front end developer with a background in communication and social media.

### About me
I have a bachelor’s degree in journalism and worked as a writer and social media manager for 8 years before discovering my love for front end development. 

🌱 I’m currently learning React and Node.js <br />
🚀 I’m studying Front End Development at [Medieinstitutet](https://medieinstitutet.se/utbildningar/front-end-developer/) and I'm looking for an internship position for the following periods: <br />
&emsp;&ensp;Internship one: October 3 - December 9 2022 <br />
&emsp;&ensp;Internship two: January 23 - May 12 2023 <br />
🐶 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me doing yoga with Adriene, watching dog videos, fueling my iced coffee addiction or rewatching old Seinfeld episodes for the 1000th time.
