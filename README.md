## 👋 Hi!

👩‍💻 I’m Malin, an aspiring front end developer with a background in communication and social media.

### About me
I have a bachelor’s degree in journalism and worked as a writer and social media manager for 8 years before discovering my love for front end development. 

🌱 I’m currently a front end developer intern at [ICA Sverige](https://www.ica.se/) <br />
🚀 Studying Front End Development at [Medieinstitutet](https://medieinstitutet.se/utbildningar/front-end-developer/) and graduating May 2023<br />
🐶 When I’m not coding, I'm probably making iced coffee, cuddling with dogs, or rewatching old Seinfeld episodes for the 1000th time.
