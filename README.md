## Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 I’m Malin, an aspiring front end developer with a background in communication and social media.

### About me
I have a bachelor’s degree in journalism and worked as a writer and social media manager for 8 years before discovering my love for front end development. 

🌱 I’m currently learning React and Node.js <br />
🚀 I’m studying Front End Development at [Medieinstitutet](https://medieinstitutet.se/utbildningar/front-end-developer/) and I graduate spring of 2023 <br />
🐶 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me doing yoga with Adriene, watching dog videos, fueling my iced coffee addiction or rewatching old Seinfeld episodes for the 1000th time.

### Languages & tools
HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript (ES6) | TypeScript | Sass | Bootstrap | Node.js | Express.js | MongoDB | Mongoose | Postman | Cypress
